                    <h1>missile man of india</h1>
                    <p><strong>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong> (1931–2015) was an eminent Indian scientist, aerospace engineer, and the 11th <strong>President of India</strong>(2002–2007). Known as the "Missile Man of India," he played a crucial role in developing India’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs, including the Agni and Prithvi missiles. His contributions to <b>ISRO</b> and <b>DRDO</b> were instrumental in making India a self-reliant space and defense power.

                    Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, in a modest family, Kalam’s early life was marked by struggles. He pursued aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology and later joined ISRO, where he worked on India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III).
                        
                    In 1998, he played a key role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, making India a nuclear power. His presidency was marked by his vision for "India 2020,"aiming for technological and economic growth.
                        
                    A beloved teacher, Kalam inspired millions through his books, including Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds. He passed away on <b>July 27, 2015</b>, while delivering a lecture. His legacy continues to inspire youth, scientists, and leaders across the world. He remains a symbol of hard work, humility, and patriotism.</p>
